Why Go?
    1. lightweight
    2. Performance (on par with c++)
    3. Less resources during execution (go's concurrency model)
    4. Simplicity

    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        * no access modifiers (public, private, protected)
        * no classes (only structs)
        * no inheritance (only composition)
        * no exceptions (only errors)
        * no "try catch finally" blocks
        * no reference types (everything is a value type)
        * no pointer arithmetic 
        * no implicit type conversion

    2. lightweight
        * compiles to native code
        * no need for any app servers
        * Performance equivalent to c++

    3. Concurrency
