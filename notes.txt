Why Go?
    1. lightweight
    2. Performance (on par with c++)
    3. Less resources during execution (go's concurrency model)
    4. Simplicity

    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        * no access modifiers (public, private, protected)
        * no classes (only structs)
        * no inheritance (only composition)
        * no exceptions (only errors)
        * no "try catch finally" blocks
        * no reference types (everything is a value type)
        * no pointer arithmetic 
        * no implicit type conversion

    2. lightweight
        * compiles to native code
        * no need for any app servers
        * Performance equivalent to c++

    3. Concurrency
        The ability to have more than one execution path in the application
        In linux, 2 MB of RAM to create a thread
        Concurrency is a language feature
            go keyword, channel (data type), <- (channel operator), select & range constructs
        SDK APIs - sync package, atomic package, runtime package



To run a go program
        go run <program_name.go>

    To create a build
        go build <program_name.go>
        go build -o <binary_name> <program_name>.go

        ./<program_name>
        OR
        <program_name>.exe

    To create a build for other platforms
    for ex: windows
    
        GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <filename.go>
        GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>

    The list of other platform configurations can be found at :
        https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment

    To change the default environment variables
        go env -w GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
        go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>
